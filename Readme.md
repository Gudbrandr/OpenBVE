## openBVE Source Code - Readme

This source code is an experimental port of openBVE to the OpenTK framework. 

### Compatibility Changes

There have also been various additions, including to the OpenBveApi, and animated objects which are described fully [here](https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Compatibility-Notes).

### Fixed Errata

These are described fully [here] (https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Errata).

### Nightly Builds

Automatically generated daily builds are available [here](http://vps.bvecornwall.co.uk/OpenBVE/Builds/).

### Developer Documentation

Documentation for development of add-ons (update version of docs originally written by _michelle_) can be found [here](https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/tree/master/Documentation).

### Packages

openBVE now supports the installation of 'package files' , which are intended as a replacement for the now defunct managed content.
These are described fully [here] (http://openbve-project.net/packages/).

### Notes

This build has been tested to compile correctly using VS2013 and MonoDevelop, but should also compile with SharpDevelop.

Joystick hat support does not function correctly in the current release build of OpenTK (1.1.4). Please compile OpenTK yourself from the most recent source if you wish to use this feature.
